### A Little About Me:
  I'm an ambitious and aspiring Software Engineer, with confidence to spare and the skills to match. I've completed a few full stack projects thus far, both as a solo act and as part of a team. I have a passion for solving problems and finding new ways to make things work; always looking for something new to learn.

I love the outdoors and being active in general, I'm something of an athlete, so I'm usually looking to play basketball, golf, go on a hike, anything sporty really. If that's not the case then you can find me reading a book or playing Playstation.
